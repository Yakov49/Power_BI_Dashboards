# Data Jobs Dashboard (Power BI)

## Introduction
This dashboard analyses a real-world dataset of **2024 data-related job postings** (titles, salaries, and locations). It consolidates scattered information into a single, interactive view to explore **market trends** and **compensation** across roles.

Built in Power BI, the report demonstrates practical skills such as **drill-through navigation**, **field parameters**, **smart tooltips**, and clear KPI design, supported by a tidy data model. The focus is on producing an interpretable, well-structured analysis rather than a business pitch.
